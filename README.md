#LIRI Bot

LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

Make sure you use the normal GitHub. Because this is a CLI App, there will be no need to deploy it to Heroku. This time, though, you need to include screenshots, a gif, and/or a video showing us that you got the app working with no bugs. You can include these screenshots or a link to a video in a README.md file.

Instructions:

.env 

SPOTIFY_ID=your-spotify-id
SPOTIFY_SECRET=your-spotify-secret


At the top of the liri.js file, add code to read and set any environment variables with the dotenv package:

require("dotenv").config();
Add the code required to import the keys.js file and store it in a variable.
